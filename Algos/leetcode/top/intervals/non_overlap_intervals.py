#
# A classic greedy case: interval scheduling problem
# 
# The heuristic is: always pick the interval with the earliest end time. Then you can get the
# maximal number of non-overlapping intervals. (or minimal number to remove).
# This is because, the interval with the earliest end time produces the maximal capacity 
# to hold rest intervals.
# E.g. Suppose current earliest end time of the rest intervals is x. Then available time slot
# left for other intervals is [x:]. If we choose another interval with end time y, then available
# time slot would be [y:]. Since x â‰¤ y, there is no way [y:] can hold more intervals then [x:].
# Thus, the heuristic holds.
# 
# Therefore, we can sort interval by ending time and key track of current earliest end time.
# Once next interval's start time is earlier than current end time, then we have to remove one interval.
# Otherwise, we update earliest end time.

def eraseOverlapIntervals(intervals):
    end, count = float('-inf'), 0

    # note: we are sorting by end times - look at explanation above
    for s, e in sorted(intervals, key = lambda interval: interval[1]):
        if s >= end:
            end = e
        else:
            # we do not update end here, because the current interval under iteration
            # is the one that is causing overlap and hence will be removed
            count += 1
    return count
