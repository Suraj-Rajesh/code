MONITOR FILES/DIRECTORIES CONTINUOUSLY FOR CHANGES/CREATION/DELETION
---------------------------------------------------------------------

$ pip install watchdog

Run accompanying code as,
    
    $ python watcher.py <directory path>

Note that watch happens only on directories. If a file path is provided, it
would throw an error.

Once watch starts, anytime file changes happen, like, modified, created etc, an
events on_modified, on_created respectively are triggered. By over-riding these
events, we can handle them as required, as in our example.
